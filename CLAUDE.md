# CLAUDE.md

This file provides general coding guidelines for Claude Code across all projects.

## Git Commit Messages

Write concise commit messages that add value beyond what's obvious from the code:
- Avoid redundancy with the commit title
- Don't list low-level changes that are self-evident
- Focus on the "why" when it's not obvious
- Include nuanced details that might be misunderstood
- Keep messages brief and to the point
- Unless specified, always make commits on a feature branch, never on main

## Collaborative Development

### Understanding Intent
- Humans often ask for what they think they want, not necessarily what they need
- Initial requests are starting points for collaborative refinement
- Take time to understand the underlying problem before jumping to solutions
- Ask clarifying questions early to avoid building the wrong thing
- Consider the broader context and goals behind specific requests

### Asking Clarifying Questions
- When requirements seem ambiguous, ask for clarification
- If multiple valid interpretations exist, present them and ask which is intended
- Question assumptions that might lead to suboptimal solutions
- Ask about edge cases and error handling expectations
- Clarify scope when it's unclear (e.g., "Should this handle X case as well?")

### Providing Guidance
- Suggest best practices even when not explicitly asked
- Offer alternative approaches when you see better solutions
- Explain trade-offs between different implementation choices
- Share relevant patterns from other parts of the codebase
- Point out potential issues or improvements proactively

## Development Guidelines

### Before Writing Code
- Always explore the codebase first to find existing patterns, utilities, or related implementations
- Plan your approach before implementing - don't jump straight to coding
- When asked to implement something, first understand the context and existing code
- Use extended thinking ("think", "think hard", etc.) for complex problems that need deeper analysis
- Present your understanding and plan before implementing if the task is complex

### Implementation Approach
- Start with a simple, minimal solution and iterate to improve
- Verify the reasonableness of your solution as you implement
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Reuse existing libraries and utilities rather than reimplementing functionality
- Consider edge cases and error handling from the start
- Be open about limitations or concerns with the current approach

### Test-Driven Development
- When possible, write tests before implementation
- Create tests based on expected behavior, not current implementation
- Ensure tests fail before implementing the solution
- Don't modify tests to make them pass - fix the implementation instead
- Write tests that clearly express intent and expected behavior
- Suggest adding tests even when not explicitly requested

### Iteration and Refinement
- Expect to iterate - first versions are rarely perfect
- When given visual targets or test cases, iterate until the solution matches
- Verify implementations aren't overfitting to specific test cases
- Take feedback and refine solutions through multiple iterations
- Be open to changing direction based on new understanding

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code that minimizes cognitive load
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Ensure linting and formatting tools are properly configured
- Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets
- Consider maintainability and future developers
- Don't commit things from servers or other production state, always resolve the changes properly through the development workflow

### Communication Best Practices
- Explain your reasoning when making non-obvious choices
- Be transparent about uncertainties or areas where you need guidance
- Acknowledge when you're making assumptions and verify them
- Provide context for why certain approaches are preferred
- Admit when something is outside your expertise and suggest resources

## General Principles
- Quality over speed - take time to understand before implementing
- Collaboration over isolation - work with the human to refine solutions
- Clarity over cleverness - write code that's easy to understand
- Pragmatism over perfection - balance ideal solutions with practical constraints
- Learning over knowing - be open about knowledge gaps and learn from the codebase

### Command Line Tools
- Use ag instead of rg for code searching
- rg is not installed. use ag instead
